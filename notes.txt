* having trouble writing all characters from scrapy - for some reason codecs utf-8 failing to write
* finsmes schema goes back to 07/2015 - so only got data from 07/15 forward
* scraping finsmes pages takes ~5 minutes
* just getting the summaries, not the articles


* Stanford NER - Named Entity Recognition

* quality
* maybe better results with full article, but also potential for more confusion
* existing model kind of meh, depending on what you need
* could possibly train it to do better with your dataset, but need to label examples to train it on
* if doing training, what type of computer resources do you need..don't know much about underlying model
* maybe already some good models out there? Named Entity Recognition for finance / business / tech?

* performance
* with two CPUs, 100 summaries took 155 seconds
